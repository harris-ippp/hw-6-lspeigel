<h2>The History of Sushi</h2>

<p>Narezushi, a form of fermented sushi, is thought to be the original form of sushi that originated in Japan around the 3rd century BCE.
Pre-refrigeration, fish could not be preserved to be eaten raw, so fermentation was the only way to preserve fish.
Fermentation is common technique found in Japanese cooking, and sushi originated as a way to store excess fish that could not be consumed immediately.
After salting and pickling the fish, the belly would be stuffed with rice, and then packaged together in wooden barrels that would sit for a year. Eventually, the rice is removed and the fish consumed.</p>

<p>After the invention of narezushi, a new form of fermeted sushi appeared, which required a shorter fermentation time.
Called han-nare sushi, this style is fermented for 1-4 weeks, and both the fish and rice are eaten. At some point in the 14th century, fermentation was cut even more drastically, down to a matter of hours or days.
This type of sushi, which can be found today in Osaka, Nara, Kyoto, or Toyama, is called haya-nare sushi.</p>

<p>In the 18th and 19th centuries, the precursor to modern sushi was invented. Here, small strips of fish would be preserved and served over vinegar rice.
Edo-mae sushi looks a lot like the sushi we see today, which were made possible with the dispersion of refrigeration techniques in the 20th century.</p>
